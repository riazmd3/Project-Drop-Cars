# Driver Dashboard Fixes Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ **Issues Fixed**

Based on your feedback, I've fixed all the critical issues with the driver dashboard:

### âœ… **1. Driver Dashboard Shows All Orders**
**Problem**: Dashboard was only showing 1 order instead of all assigned orders
**Solution**: 
- Updated UI to display all assigned orders in a scrollable list
- Added proper sorting by scheduled date/time
- Shows current active trip separately at the top
- Displays all other assigned trips below

### âœ… **2. Trip Management System**
**Problem**: No trip start/end functionality
**Solution**:
- Added `handleStartTrip()` function to start trips
- Added `handleEndTrip()` function to end trips
- Added `updateAssignmentStatus()` function to update assignment status
- Prevents starting new trips while one is active
- Shows current active trip prominently

### âœ… **3. Online/Offline Toggle Fixed**
**Problem**: Toggle didn't fetch current status and handle state properly
**Solution**:
- Added `fetchDriverStatus()` function to get current status from API
- Updated `toggleStatus()` to refresh status after toggle
- Added status fetching on component load
- Proper error handling for status updates

### âœ… **4. Assignment Details Authentication Fixed**
**Problem**: 401 "User not found" error when fetching assignment details
**Solution**:
- Updated `getDriverAssignmentsWithDetails()` to use correct endpoint
- Removed dependency on assignment details API that was causing 401 errors
- Uses data directly from the assigned orders response

- **Assigned Trips**: Shows pending trips with "Start Trip" button

### **3. Enhanced Status Toggle**
