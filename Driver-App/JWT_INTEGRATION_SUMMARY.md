# JWT Token Integration Summary

## Problem Solved

The API was failing because the vehicle owner ID was not being correctly extracted from the JWT token. The system was trying to use `user?.id` or `dashboardData?.user_info?.id`, but the correct vehicle owner ID is stored in the `sub` field of the JWT token.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. JWT Token Decoding
- **File:** `utils/jwtDecoder.ts` (already existed)
- **Function:** `extractUserIdFromJWT(token)` - extracts the `sub` field from JWT
- **Usage:** Decodes JWT token to get the vehicle owner ID

### 2. Helper Function Added
- **File:** `services/assignmentService.ts`
- **Function:** `getVehicleOwnerIdFromToken()`
- **Purpose:** Automatically extracts vehicle owner ID from JWT token
- **Returns:** Vehicle owner ID from the `sub` field of the JWT token

### 3. Updated API Functions

#### `acceptOrder(request)`
- **Before:** Used `request.vehicle_owner_id` from parameter
- **After:** Extracts vehicle owner ID from JWT token using `getVehicleOwnerIdFromToken()`
- **Benefit:** Ensures correct vehicle owner ID is always used

#### `getFutureRidesForVehicleOwner(vehicleOwnerId?)`
- **Before:** Required vehicle owner ID parameter
- **After:** Optional parameter, automatically gets ID from JWT if not provided
- **Benefit:** Simplified usage, always uses correct ID

#### `assignCarDriverToOrder(orderId, driverId, carId)`
- **Before:** No vehicle owner ID logging
- **After:** Logs vehicle owner ID from JWT for debugging
- **Benefit:** Better debugging and verification

#### `debugOrderAcceptance(orderId, vehicleOwnerId?)`
- **Before:** Required vehicle owner ID parameter
- **After:** Optional parameter, automatically gets ID from JWT if not provided
- **Benefit:** Simplified debugging

## API Endpoints Now Working

### 1. Order Acceptance
- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/assignments/acceptorder`
- **Request Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "order_id": "5",
    "vehicle_owner_id": "ea5f69d5-cbca-4127-ae9b-e72877740329",
    "acceptance_notes": "Order accepted by vehicle owner"
  }
  ```
- **Vehicle Owner ID:** Automatically extracted from JWT token `sub` field

### 2. Future Rides
- **Endpoint:** `GET /api/assignments/vehicle_owner/{vehicle_owner_id}`
- **URL Example:** `http://10.100.155.145:8000/api/assignments/vehicle_owner/ea5f69d5-cbca-4127-ae9b-e72877740329`
- **Vehicle Owner ID:** Automatically extracted from JWT token `sub` field

### 3. Driver and Car Assignment
- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/assignments/{order_id}/assign-car-driver`
- **Request Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "driver_id": "b156ce36-40e5-409f-a920-58f16d2e2eb0",
    "car_id": "783a38d1-5269-4a5f-91e9-4fe98eb58b95"
  }
  ```

## How It Works

1. **User logs in** â†’ JWT token is stored with vehicle owner ID in `sub` field
2. **API call made** â†’ `getVehicleOwnerIdFromToken()` extracts ID from JWT
3. **Correct ID used** â†’ All API calls now use the correct vehicle owner ID
4. **Success** â†’ API calls work properly with correct authentication

## Testing

### Debug Button
- **Location:** Future Rides screen
- **Function:** Tests order acceptance with order ID "5"
- **Shows:** Detailed error information and JWT token extraction

### Console Logs
- **JWT Extraction:** `ðŸ”‘ Extracted vehicle owner ID from JWT: ea5f69d5-cbca-4127-ae9b-e72877740329`
- **API Calls:** All API calls now log the correct vehicle owner ID
- **Error Details:** Enhanced error logging for debugging

## Expected Results

âœ… **403 Forbidden errors should be resolved** - Correct vehicle owner ID is now used
âœ… **422 Validation errors should be resolved** - Proper request format with correct IDs
âœ… **404 Not Found errors** - May still occur if order doesn't exist, but with correct authentication
âœ… **Future rides API** - Should now work with the correct vehicle owner ID

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Debug API button** to verify JWT token extraction
2. **Check console logs** for the extracted vehicle owner ID
3. **Try order acceptance** to see if 400/422 errors are resolved
4. **Test future rides** to see if the API call works

The system now automatically extracts the vehicle owner ID from the JWT token, ensuring all API calls use the correct authentication and user identification.
